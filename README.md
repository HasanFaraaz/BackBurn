# BackBurn
Modified KenBurn View so that it can be used as a background.

Go to this link for ken burns effect https://github.com/flavioarfaria/KenBurnsView

I have made this project such that you can use the KenBurn View as the background.

Currently there is a button(does nothing) and a Label.

[![Demo BackBurn](http://share.gifyoutube.com/yXO41W.gif)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZvBY1w15Zo&feature=youtu.be)

Go to **Styles.xml** and edit the **BackGroundImageView** to change the properties of the effect, and do not forget to add kenburn library in gradle script.
